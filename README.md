# Bloopy - Tamagotchi Emulator

**Bloopy** is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet emulator built in Rust. You can interact with your digital pet, feed it, and keep it alive, just like the original Tamagotchi from the '90s. It's a fun way to bring back the nostalgia of taking care of a virtual pet right in your terminal!

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Feed, check health, and manage your virtual pet's well-being.
- **Terminal-based UI**: Fully operable from the terminal with easy-to-read commands.
- **Customizable Settings**: Modify pet attributes and care options for more personalized interaction.
- **Image Display**: View pixel art of your virtual pet, updated as it changes over time.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: The emulator is built in Rust, so you'll need to have it installed. You can install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- **Image Files**: The game uses images (in `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` formats) to represent your pet's current state, loaded from an `assets` directory.
